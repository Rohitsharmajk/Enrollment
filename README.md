# Enrollment
It's an enrollment project using Tkinter library in python.
This is how it works:
It'll show you two options - Login or Register
If you choose log in, then it'll show you message that "You have Logged In Successfully".
If you go for Register, then it'll open a new window and ask you for your credentials. After you press register button, it'll save your credentials to a ".txt" file name "register".
Therefore, now you can access your Entered data from that "register.txt" file.
Thank You
